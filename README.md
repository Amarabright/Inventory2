## INTRODUCTION
This is an Inventory Management analysis done with SQL and PowerBI, I analyzed Inventory data, production data and Sales data from the AdventureWorks 2019 database. It is a fictitious company named "FitCapacity" and it is intended to solve some problems.
Disclaimer This is not a real company as we know that adventure works database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes



## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The goal of the analysis is to:
+ identify which products have the highest turnover rate and which have the lowest turnover rate.
* identify the average time a product is out of stock and the frequency of stockouts.
- classify products into high-selling, low-selling and average-selling.
- use the insights gained to make recommendations for how to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts which may include adjustments to reorder points, ordering certain products, or discontinuing products that are not selling well.
